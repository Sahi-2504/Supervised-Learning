# Supervised-Learning
Medical research university X is undergoing a deep research on patients with certain conditions.
University has an internal AI team. Due to confidentiality the patient’s details and the conditions are masked by
the client by providing different datasets to the AI team for developing a AIML model which can predict the
condition of the patient depending on the received test results. 

 The data consists of biomechanics features of the patients according to their current
conditions. Each patient is represented in the data set by six biomechanics attributes derived from the shape and
orientation of the condition to their body part.
